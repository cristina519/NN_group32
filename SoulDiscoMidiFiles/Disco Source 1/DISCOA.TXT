DiscoA.mid is a disco beat. Unlike DiscoB, it doesn't have that kick drum on
every downbeat, so it has a less driving bottom end. On the other hand, it
has a more syncopated hihat part, which tends to compensate.
    For modern drum beats, you're free to choose the drum sounds that best
suit your preference (ie, decide whether you want ringing or dead sounds).
    This arrangement has an 8 bar intro. The rest of the arrangement is fairly
open-ended being that modern songs don't necessarily follow the old 16 bar
verse/16 bar chorus of old standards. But typically, there is a 16 bar
verse/16 bar chorus followed by an 8 or 4 bar bridge.
